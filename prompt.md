1. The Intelligent Incident Response Agent The Scenario: A SaaS company's on-call engineers waste 60% of their time on false alerts and routine fixes. Build an AI agent that analyzes monitoring data, correlates events, and either auto-remediates or escalates with context. The Constraints: ● Ingest simulated telemetry data (metrics + logs in JSON/Prometheus format) ● Implement a decision tree: Auto-fix → Human-in-loop approval → Escalate ● Use an LLM for root cause analysis (correlate multiple signals) ● Demonstrate handling at least 3 incident types (memory leak, API timeout, disk full) ● Must provide reasoning for each action taken Success Metric: ● False positive rate (should reject non-issues) ● Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) and suggested resolution ● Quality of root cause explanation Tech Suggestions: LangChain/LangGraph, any LLM API, Docker for simulated services we are planning to create a backend server using python. to mimic the necessary incidents and log it. and we also need to deploy this and log and trigger error to an agent as wel as send mail to devs.give the python code setup aswell as the way to deploy and log. this error and sent to the ai agent and ai agent can also read the logs based on the time. the development of the ai agent will be handled by another team so dont bother about that
